# Job Maker

Making SLURM (or other) job scripts to submit jobs to a [SLURM cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slurm_Workload_Manager) is annoying. Research Computing at Stanford, [inspired by NERSC](https://my.nersc.gov/script_generator.php), have created this static tool that you (some cluster admin) can tweak the configuration for, and then serve statically for your users.

## Configuration

The configuration and specification for your cluster is defined by files in the [assets/data](assets/data) folder.
